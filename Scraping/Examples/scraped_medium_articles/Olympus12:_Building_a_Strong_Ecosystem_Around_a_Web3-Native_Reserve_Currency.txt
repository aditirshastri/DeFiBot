Given the scale and scope of Olympus’ activities, it can be difficult for the community to monitor and evaluate the DAO’s performance. In addition to creating new dashboards and metrics outlining and measuring the DAO’s activities, we will publish quarterly reports on the Olympus12 Action Plan beginning in late Q1 2022/early Q2 2022.
Also, progress on the Olympus12 Action Plan will be regularly reported during community calls, our newsletter, Twitter and other channels.

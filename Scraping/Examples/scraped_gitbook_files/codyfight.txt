Problem
Creative tech-savvy players identify multiple pain points that are not properly addressedLimited places for talented people to have fun, create, express themselves, and reap fair rewardsVideo gaming, eSports, and crypto industries are booming billion-dollar markets predicted to continue growing over the next decade
 With it, the gaming industry will get more opportunities to merge with the NFT market
 The lines between gaming and working have become blurred as an increasing number of people now list tech-savvy as one of their various interests and talents
However, there are not that many games where creative tech-savvy people can truly express themselves and get fair rewards for it
 The majority of current games, especially those made by the older generation of developers, limit the players in various ways
 They do not provide ownership of player assets, offer limited opportunities to earn money, involve too much everyday engagement, and only harness one discipline or skill set
We believe here lies a massive opportunity to add to the growth of the Game Fi and P2E industries - a game changer in the form of a blockchain-based game focused on multi-talented people in the current gaming market
Creative tech-savvy players lack simple and accessible opportunities to contribute to games and earn from their contributionGaming enthusiasts are prone to creating various assets and values related to their favorite games, including artistic drawings, music, videos, community events, and so on
 However, most of the time they have very limited opportunities to benefit from their creative efforts or they have to utilize third-party platforms like Youtube or Twitch
Only the best players can make a living from gamingThe current gaming industry properly awards only the best of the best players while mediocre fans receive no monetary benefits from playing the games
 This situation has created additional problems - the truly passionate gamers cannot afford to play games as much as they would like
 On a side note, in 2021 there were only about 2,000 pro-gamers worldwide who could afford to live from gaming (https://readyesports

No asset ownershipThe majority of games are old-fashioned, and players don’t own their in-game assets
 This means they cannot trade outside the game, limiting their opportunities to benefit from their beloved games
Limited places for AI to interplay with humansIn 2021, most games typically implement some sort of AI behavior
 However, AI in games is limited by generally being incorporated into NPCs that do not play a significant role in the competition, or such games are played offline in the single-player mode
 AI behavior in such games is preprogrammed by game developers and is rarely affected by the community's suggestions
 AI (ro)bots have little to no places to interplay and compete with humans, as well as each other
Poor competitive environment for programmersThere is no de-facto way for programmers to compete and show off their coding skills
Coding games do not focus on gamer needsCurrently, the majority of coding games primarily target teachers, students, and companies - not individual gamers
 On top of that, automated playing by coding bots is globally considered cheating.

Governance
Codyfight is a blockchain-powered community-driven AI vs
 human decentralized competition metaverse
 Therefore, further gameplay features will be confirmed or rejected by the community
 Token holders will be given the possibility to participate in voting for upcoming game features
 The Codyfight Token allocation size may impact the voting power of the holder
 By following this direction, Codyfight will become more popular and more balanced for players, especially considering that not many game development companies today listen to their users’ complaints about problems or balance flaws in the actual game

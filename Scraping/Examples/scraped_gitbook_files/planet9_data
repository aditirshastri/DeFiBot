comWe’re happy that you have found your way to our White Paper, where we’ll outline the core parts of Planet IX
 As the team is constantly developing and improving the game, some segments are left out for now - all in the spirit of pioneering this space
 We have strict deadlines and strive to push updates as quickly and regularly as possible - and we take this duty very seriously

The game is set in a post-apocalyptic world, where you, our players, also known as Agents of Change (AOC), have returned to a shattered world with a desire to rebuild it towards an ultimate utopia
 Through collective restoration work, such as waste collection and developing blossoming Territories

The world is made up of more than 1
6 billion hexagonal land parcels called PIX, which are ERC 721 assets that players trade, store and develop into Territories in order to create value
 Based on real-world attributes and geographical rarity, the game includes five tiers of PIX, ranging from Legendary PIX (Capital City Centers) to Outlier PIX (Deserts and Mountains)
 Binding everything together is our ERC-20 IX Token ($IXT), used for all in-game transactions, interactions with our in-game corporations, developing PIX, and as rewards for AOCs
 The $IXT also functions as the game’s governance token

Every tier has its set amount of PIX required for creating a Territory
 For instance, an Outlier Area requires 10 PIX to form while Legendary requires 50 PIX
 There are five sizes of Territories, Area, Sector, Zone and Domain
 Five areas form a Sector, two Sectors form a Zone and two Zones form a Domain
 Territories are then staked for $IXT rewards
 The Territory staking pool is generated from land sales and other in-game purchases and is divided amongst the Territory holders, with Legendary Territories claiming the largest rewards

This is the core of Planet IX, the Territories that ties all of your PIX together
 With greater Territories, you’ll be able to expand your gaming experience and reap the benefits of larger pools of rewards
 To ensure our game is accessible to everyone, we are also launching our free-to-play game features

Planet IX went on-chain on the 22nd of November 2021 after 6 months of intensive product and community building, and today all game assets are on-chain

The White Paper will break this all and more down over the next 76 pages
Introduction & VisionWe are at the dawn of digital property rights and non-fungible tokens
 NFTs emerged as early as 2016, with projects like Age of Chains and Rare Pepes using Bitcoin to create blockchain trading cards
 These early experiments morphed into larger projects during the halcyon days of 2017 and 2018
 In particular, the launch of CryptoKitties seemed to capture lightning in a bottle with its potent mix of cat memes and an enthused and ever-expanding community
 Now the internet was ready and eager for whatever was next
 NFTs went from simple ownables to bona-fide collectibles overnight
 The rise and frenzy of collectors, memelords and internet aficionados proved that NFTs are here to stay

NFTs have since evolved far beyond these early experiments
 Millions of dollars are being commissioned to artists through platforms like SupeRare and OpenSea
 More recently we’ve been seeing the emergence of next-generation NFTs and platforms, expanding into digital art and land purchasing
 We’re beginning to see NFTs intersect with trends in DeFi (like Aavegotchi, MEME, and WHALE), and also serve as the bedrock for next-generation gaming platforms and the emerging metaverse
 Decentraland and Cryptovoxels are both great examples that serve flashing glimmers into worlds that we could earlier only see visualized in science fiction films like Ready Player One

Today, we’re at a turning point in the application of NFTs
 One where we can carve out robust property rights in the digital realm in a way that mirrors the real world
 Trillions of dollars of intellectual property and data rights, along with billions of dollars of art and other entertainment value could one day be managed by a blockchain

Planet IX is at the forefront of a revolution in the virtual land strategy development space
 It provides tools to decentralize and empower the gaming community, while also helping individuals use their passion and skill to play and build businesses
 Blurring the lines between the digital and the physical world, we and the players redefine the term reality again and again
Fractional vaultsWith fractionalization of NFTs, holders can create their own DAOs, divide rewards to their network, spread wealth across their strongest supporters and work together to accumulate wealth
 Guilds can build multi-asset vaults to optimize capital efficiency and manage their DAO treasury more democratically, while individual players may accumulate massive amounts of assets and wealth with the buying power of their community
 Fractional Vaults also allow for the most scarce and rarest assets of the game to be owned by many
 For instance, if a DAO acquires a Domain Territory it can vault the Domain Territory and distribute shares to all members
 Players can also form alliances around Vaults - a vault that all players from this area may own a stake in and which carries a large accumulation of territories
 We believe in the power of DAOs and will act to provide the foundation of creating a decentralized platform where the players own and decide on the future together

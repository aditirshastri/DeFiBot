Introduction
Welcome to the Dexsport documentation portalToday, the betting platforms market is occupied by monopolists - big players, who control the odds on various events
 It complicates the situation not only for the owners of smaller platforms but also for players themselves: even if they win fairly, they will find it difficult to get their money due to constant identification procedures and stricter payouts
In order to change the situation, authors of the Dexsport project developed decentralized betting platform, in which users will play with a shared pool of liquidity and receive winnings via blockchain
 This platform includes sports betting, play to earn betting, prediction marketplace, P2P betting on exchange rates, and NFT art collecting
The decentralized platform format was chosen due to the transparency of procedures and the increasing popularity of DAO
 DeFi provides unique opportunities for players in the gambling space
 Has a decentralized protocol, betting will need no bookmaker for a bet to be placed
The market for DeFi projects is becoming increasingly solid, vast and saturated, and Dexsport will obviously enhance its growth and development and be entitled as a brand new decentralized betting platform, where every user will be able to observe in person all the processes previously hidden from him and receive his winnings honestly

 Each event outcome is checked through a data oracle
Oracle IntegrationDexsport will be utilizing ChainLink as the preferred oracle to port data from off-chain API's on to the BSC
 ChainLink has proven to be the most reliable and fastest growing oracle service in the space
 ChainLink allows developers to custom code access to any off-chain API
 The oracle will check the outcomes of the data for reliability, which is why we chose ChainLink so that there was a transparent validity of all events
